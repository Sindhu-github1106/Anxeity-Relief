## 💡 About the Project

This project was built as part of a design + tech assignment where we had to conceptualize, prototype, and build a real-world application to address a pressing mental health challenge. We created a **wearable anxiety relief system** using a **pulse-detecting glove** (built with Arduino Uno and a pulse sensor) and a **Python-based desktop application (Tkinter)** to guide users through sound therapy, journaling, and breathing exercises when high pulse rates were detected.

## 🔍 DIS (Designing Interactive Systems) Concepts Used

- **Affordances & Feedback**
- **Multimodal Interaction**
- **Mental Models**
- **Context Awareness**

## 🎯 Impact

- Promotes emotional self-awareness  
- Encourages healthy coping mechanisms  
- A low-cost, accessible solution for young adults  

## 📊 Research Highlights

- **Top Triggers:** Academic pressure, performance, and social situations  
- **Coping Preferences:** Deep breathing, listening to music, talking to someone  
- **Behavioral Insight:** Most users do not consistently track their pulse

## ✨ Two-Line Summary

We designed an anxiety relief app paired with a wearable glove using Arduino Uno and a pulse sensor. The desktop app, built with Python's Tkinter, helps users manage anxiety in real-time using breathing exercises, sound therapy, and journaling.
